# Handwritten-Digit-Identification
Automatic digit recognition is of popular interest today. Deep Learning techniques makes it possible for object recognition in image data. 
The MNIST handwritten digit classification problem is common in computer vision and deep learning. It can be used to identify hand-written digits ranging from 0-9.
In terms of machine learning and computer vision, it is a classification problem, where the primary outcome is the identification and classification of handwritten digits by machines ranging from 0-9.
Without further ado, lets dive into the dataset and preprocessing.
